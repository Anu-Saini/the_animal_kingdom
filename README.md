## Description 
This web-application built as Wildlife learning platform which can be referenced for inforamtion for any particular animal.

## Get Started
you will need to clone repository from https://github.com/Anu-Saini/the_animal_kingdom.git

The project depandencies can be downloaded via npm package manager using ```npm install``` command.

We have to created a database 'animal-database' in 'MongoDB' by creating an account on MongoDB.

Once the database is created, we need to create collections and feed in initial data by  running the ```npm   run seed``` script.

Once the collections are in place, we need to populate the database by seeding the tables with data by running the script seeds using terminal as advised above

We connect to the server via dotenv.

## Using the Application
The application has been developed with help of both front end and back end code using MERN techonology and tools. The front end has been developed using REACT.js while the back end is supoorted by Node and express.js.
